2) Implement zombie catch

Home screen Design

Implement warp out and you lose

mvp

change character controls
add cooldown for warping
reconfigure awaken ranges on zombies
change speed if necessary
add end game screen and navigation back to title
add how to play

Things to add for polish:
0) refactor

0.5) fix torch hit boxes

1) -spice up home screen with colors on selection and
   -something in the background
   -a fade in on the initial play through of the game

2) -level transitions need titles and subtitles

3) landing screen for endgame (some kind of cool art and thanks for playing thing)
