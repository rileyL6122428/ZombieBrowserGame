Things to add for polish:
0) refactor

0.5) fix torch hit boxes

1) -spice up home screen with colors on selection and
   -something in the background
   -a fade in on the initial play through of the game

2) -level transitions need titles and subtitles

3) landing screen for endgame (some kind of cool art and thanks for playing thing)
