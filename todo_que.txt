2) Implement zombie catch

Home screen Design

Implement warp out and you lose

mvp

(get character capture to register)
(character flashes and then splits and disappears)
(game reverts back to homescreen)
(the level the player reached is now accessable from the home screen)

Things to add for polish:
1) -spice up home screen with colors on selection and
   -something in the background
   -a fade in on the initial play through of the game

2) -level transitions need titles and subtitles

3) landing screen for endgame (some kind of cool art and thanks for playing thing)
