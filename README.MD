#Zombie Escape

###Basic Mechanics Demo

###MVP

Zombie Escape is a 2D browser game. The core mechanics center around players
progressing through levels by lighting (touching) torches while evading capture
by zombies. The features absolutely necessary for this game to function are:

* A moving/ animated player avatar
* Animated zombies that chase the player
* Zombie variety (3 to 4 types of zombies)
* Switches/ lightable torches
* 3 to 5 playable levels
* A home screen with instructions on how to play
